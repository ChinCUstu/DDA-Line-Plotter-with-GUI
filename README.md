# **DDA Line Plotter with GUI**
This project uses Python's Tkinter library to implement a Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows users to input the initial and final points and plot the line using Matplotlib.

## Features
DDA Algorithm: Computes the intermediate points between the initial and final coordinates.

Tkinter GUI: Provides an easy-to-use interface for inputting coordinates.

Matplotlib Plot: Visualizes the computed line graphically.

## How to Use
**1. Install Dependencies:**

  Tkinter (usually included with Python)
  Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)

**2. Run the Application:**

  Execute the dda_line_plotter.py script.

  Input the initial and final coordinates in the provided fields.

  Click "Plot Line" to visualize the DDA line.
